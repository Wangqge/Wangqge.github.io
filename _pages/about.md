I joined [Northeastern University (China)](http://english.neu.edu.cn/) as a Professor in February 2026.
From 2022 to 2026, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the National University of Singapore, working with [Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/index.html) in the [Xtra computing group](https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/). I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science from [Northeastern University (China)](http://english.neu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Ge Yu](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/yuge/en/index.htm) and Prof. [Yanfeng Zhang](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/zhangyf/en/index.htm). I worked closely with Prof. [Xiaodong Zhang](https://cse.osu.edu/people/zhang.574) and Dr. [Hao Wang](https://www.sites.google.com/site/hwang121) from 2018 to 2022. 

My research interests include parallel graph processing and learning systems, graph-based RAG and agents, and data processing and management on GPUs and NPUs. **I am actively looking for self-motivated Master and PhD students to join my research group in Fall 2026/2027**. If you are interested in my research, please reach out to me via *wangqg[at] mail.neu.edu.cn with your CV and transcript*.
