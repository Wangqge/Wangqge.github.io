Currently I am a postdoc research fellow working with [Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/index.html) at NUS [Xtra computing group](https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/). I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science from [Northeastern University (China)](http://english.neu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Ge Yu](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/yuge/en/index.htm) and Prof. [Yanfeng Zhang](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/zhangyf/en/index.htm). I worked closely with Prof. [Xiaodong Zhang](https://cse.osu.edu/people/zhang.574) and Dr. [Hao Wang](https://www.sites.google.com/site/hwang121) from 2018 to 2022. **I will join [Northeastern University in China](http://english.neu.edu.cn/) in 2026 spring.**
My research interest include parallel graph processing/learning system, Graph-based RAG and agents, and data processing/mangament on GPUs and NPU. I am actively looking for self-motivated Master’s and PhD students to join my research group at Fall 2026/2027. If you are interested in my research topics, please reach out to me via email with your CV.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
